Tools and IR languages for compiling languages.


This package is designed to assist in compiling languages to produce
executable files.  At the moment, it contains one IR language, though
others are planned.

 * SimpleIR: A simply-typed language with flat scopes, whose
   instructions correspond to LLVM's.  However, SimpleIR has mutable
   variables, supports variant types (not implemented), and allows
   variables of any type (not implemented).  Also, it makes
   instruction selection decisions based on the types of arguments
   (not implemented).

   Simple IR also contains rather elaborate information pertaining to
   garbage collection.


 * PolyIR (not implemented): A polymorphically-typed IR language with
   nested scopes and patterns.


Compilation steps are as follows:

 * SimpleIR to LLVM: convert types and generate metadata to capture
   garbage collection and other information, SSA construction,
   generate LLVM instructions.

 * PolyIR to SimpleIR (not implemented): monomorphize and boxing to
   eliminate polymorphic types, scope analysis and static linking.



*NOTE*: This package in under active design and development.  The
 SimpleIR language is likely to change and/or expand.  Compilation to
 LLVM is only partially complete at this point, and some important
 things are not supported (structures as local variables, variant
 types at all, etc.)
